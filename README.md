# Analysis of Flight Delays

In this repository, you will find code used to perform exploratory data analysis on flight delay data for the months of January 2019 and January 2020, which includes 17 Airlines and 346 airports. The code is available as a Jupyter notebook.

The csv files used are from Kaggle.com and are larger than allowed to push to github. Here's a link to the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction?select=Jan_2019_ontime.csv) page with the datasets and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NsDjnWhG2bDPUwpMp9K-m35zKEgGYA7m?usp=sharing) linked in a drive.
